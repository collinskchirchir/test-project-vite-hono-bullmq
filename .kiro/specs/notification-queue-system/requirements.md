# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a scalable notification queuing system using BullMQ and Redis to handle SMS notifications (with future support for email notifications) in a monorepo containing a HonoJS API and Next.js web application. The system is designed for easy maintenance and extensibility, allowing different notification types and templates to be added without significant refactoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Queue Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized queue package that can be shared across the monorepo, so that notification processing is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL establish a Redis connection for BullMQ
2. WHEN a queue is created THEN it SHALL be configured with appropriate retry policies and error handling
3. IF Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN the queue package is imported THEN it SHALL expose queue instances, worker instances, and job creation utilities
5. WHEN multiple applications access the queue THEN they SHALL share the same Redis instance configuration

### Requirement 2: SMS Notification Queue

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to queue SMS notifications with different templates, so that messages can be sent asynchronously without blocking API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SMS job is added to the queue THEN it SHALL include recipient phone number, template type, and template data
2. WHEN an SMS worker processes a job THEN it SHALL select the appropriate template based on job type
3. IF an SMS job fails THEN it SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN an SMS template is needed THEN the system SHALL support welcome, OTP, and generic notification templates
5. WHEN template data is provided THEN it SHALL be validated against the template's expected schema
6. WHEN an SMS is successfully sent THEN the job SHALL be marked as completed

### Requirement 3: Template Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured template system for notifications, so that I can easily add new message templates without modifying core queue logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is created THEN it SHALL define its expected data schema using TypeScript types
2. WHEN a template is invoked THEN it SHALL return a formatted message string
3. WHEN template data is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL throw a validation error
4. WHEN adding a new template THEN it SHALL only require creating a new template file and registering it
5. WHEN templates are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by notification type (sms, email)

### Requirement 4: Worker Process Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dedicated worker processes for each notification type, so that different notification channels can be scaled independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker starts THEN it SHALL connect to its designated queue
2. WHEN a worker processes a job THEN it SHALL handle the job according to its notification type
3. IF a worker encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error with job context
4. WHEN a worker completes a job THEN it SHALL remove it from the queue
5. WHEN workers are deployed THEN they SHALL be able to run as separate processes or in the same process

### Requirement 5: Job Creation Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe job creation functions, so that I can queue notifications from any part of the application with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an SMS job THEN the function SHALL accept typed parameters for template and data
2. WHEN a job is queued THEN it SHALL return a job ID for tracking
3. IF job data is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a type error at compile time
4. WHEN queuing from the HonoJS API THEN it SHALL use the same job creation interface as Next.js
5. WHEN a job is created THEN it SHALL support optional priority and delay parameters

### Requirement 6: Extensibility for Future Notification Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system architecture to support adding email notifications in the future, so that the codebase remains maintainable as requirements grow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new notification type THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern as SMS (queue, worker, templates, jobs)
2. WHEN notification types are added THEN existing notification types SHALL not require modification
3. WHEN the system exports utilities THEN it SHALL provide a consistent interface across notification types
4. WHEN workers are organized THEN each notification type SHALL have its own worker file
5. WHEN templates are added THEN they SHALL be organized in type-specific directories

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration for Redis and queue settings, so that connection details and queue options can be managed in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read Redis configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN queue options are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in a central configuration file
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults for development
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN it SHALL not require code changes in multiple files
5. WHEN different environments are used THEN the configuration SHALL support development, staging, and production settings

### Requirement 8: Type Safety and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for all queue operations, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN job data is defined THEN it SHALL have a TypeScript interface
2. WHEN template functions are created THEN they SHALL have typed parameters
3. WHEN queue operations are performed THEN they SHALL return typed results
4. WHEN importing queue utilities THEN TypeScript SHALL provide autocomplete for available templates
5. WHEN job types are defined THEN they SHALL be discriminated unions for type narrowing
